    "In this article/notebook, IÊ»ll discuss MankiwÊ»s brief and prominent *contrepot* to PikettyÊ»s famous equation from his very popular work, *Capital in the Twenty-First Centrury*. Why a python notebook? IÊ»m not entirely sure, though IÊ»ll note that the Mankiw response answers the Piketty, with (possibly bad) math for math. Call it a hunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MankiwÊ»s defense, by 2015 America had not yet become a living laboratory for r > g through its serial election of the living incarnation of misanthropic dynastic wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "ThatÊ»s about the only defense I can think of, though. History has not been kind to MankiwÊ»s \n",
    "\n",
    "Mankiw lays his cards on the table early: \"To someone who views relatively unfettered capitalism as one of the great achievements of human history and the best way to organize a society, as I do...\" ...and we are properly primed for the rest of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "(By the way, when you pick a \"great achievement of human history,\" consider selecting one that neednÊ»t be double-qualified as \"relatively unfettered.\" For instance, \"The written word.\" \"WomenÊ»s rights.\" \"Spaceflight.\" \"Pre-natal care.\" Or, as a proscriptionary example: \"Relatively unfettered pre-natal care.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The article continues about as expected, though this next bit is surprising in degree:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The first thing to say about Pikettyâ€™s logic is that it will seem strange to any economist trained in the neoclassical theory of economic growth. The condition r > g should be familiar. In the textbook Solow growth model, it arrives naturally as a steady-state condition as long as the economy does not save so much as to push the capital stock beyond the Golden Rule level (Phelps 1961). In this model, r > g is not a problem, but r < g could be. If the rate of return is less than the growth rate, the economy has accumulated an excessive amount of capital. In this dynamically inefficient situation, all generations can be made better off by reducing the economyâ€™s saving rate. From this perspective, we should be reassured that we live in a world in which r > g because it means we have not left any dynamic Pareto improvements unexploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: \"Of course r > g: the model wouldnÊ»t work correctly if it isnÊ»t that way.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "And quickly we see the problem whooshing over MankiwÊ»s head: except that this should be impossible---is impossible---for a scholar with Professor MankiwÊ»s towering qualifications. WeÊ»re left to immediately wonder what could possibly be going on behind the scenes here. Obviously, if a \"working\" model is predicting the kind of effects that lead to societal discord sufficient to put American Democracy, of late, on the ropes, we might consider ourselves warned rather than consoled by its smooth linear functioning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there no r > g that Mankiw would find troubling? In the Matrix, the robot empire seemed to enjoy a solid rate of return on a very poor growth rate for humanity. The machines were excellent Pareto optimizers. r > g, so what, Neo?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we make our way to the Three Vexes of Being Filthy Rich. \"He can pass his wealth on to his children, but to ensure that his descendants remain wealthy, he faces three obstacles.\" (I personally would have used \"she\" here, because I am old fashioned.)\n",
    "Lamborghinis (\"and riotous living but also political and philanthropic contributions\"): This paragraph seems almost designed to poke at readers, but from a math perspective: isnÊ»t consumption is a tiny intricate scalar on r at best. I say at best, since I think real consumption among the most rich is shockingly low.\n",
    "Inheritance: Okay, well, at least weÊ»ve graduated to a factor on r, but as @Tanya Bils points out above, money isnÊ»t the only thing being bequeathed here, and \"here, let me get Grandpa Walton on the phone\" probably doesnÊ»t dilute quite the way Mankiw claims it does. I suspect there is something more flawed about this argument related to discrete time and asynchronous inputs, but that seems a bit more work than a press release deserves in response.\n",
    "Third: taxes. Again a scalar, and--seemingly--failing to point out that half of it is already inherently baked into to the r in r > g. Unless youÊ»re sufficiently billionaire, of course, in which case the scalar <= 0. One does wonder, though, if Mankiw ever paid any kind of social or political price for fiercely advocating for the balancing necessity of estate taxes.\n",
    "Mankiw then goes on to paste some assumptions into each of his equations to conveniently arrive at an adjusted r that just barely balances on g. Just the right scalars and just the right factors! In doing so, of course, he dooms his entire scholarly exercise---since surely, even if his wet-thumb-in-the-wind parameters are miraculously within an order of magnitude of being correct, they are so for his time only, and at other times (see: 2025, approximately mid-February) and with other parameters, r is likely to curb stomp g. Metaphorically speaking. Somewhat.\n",
    "However, the most important flaw in the Mankiw comes in the next paragraph:\n",
    "This scenario is far from what we have experienced. Piketty estimates the real rate of return to be about 4 or 5 percent, which seems plausible for a typical balanced portfolio. Meanwhile, the average growth rate of the US economy has been about 3 percent. So Piketty is right that r has exceeded g, but it has done so by only about 2 percentage points, not the more than 7 percentage points necessary for the creation of Pikettyâ€™s imagined dystopia.\n",
    "How fortunate, then, for the very wealthy, that they do not have to suffer through the doldrums of a \"typical balanced portfolio.\" The idea that the very wealthy do not enjoy far superior returns on capital than average seems so obvious that it is difficult to imagine how Mankiw could have, as an impartial analyst, overlooked it. Perhaps his enthrallment with the sheer moral correctness of the overall system blinded him to this key point.\n",
    "The reason that this is a crucial point is that, even when r just equals g, there will still very likely be a major segment of those returns, r*, where r* > r > g, where the r* has a concentrating power that attenuates even further as the rest of the \"entrepreneur class\" (otherwise known as basic millionaires) struggles.\n",
    "ðŸ’° ðŸ’° ðŸ’°\n",
    "The significant balance of the article posits a theoretical model, the details of which I do not have time tonight to work through step by step. Mankiw, thankfully, hands us a default in his setup:\n",
    "Consider an economy composed of two kinds of peopleâ€”workers and capitalists. Many workers supply labor inelastically and immediately consume their earnings. A few capitalists own the capital stock and, because they represent an infinitely-living dynasty, set their consumption according to the standard model of an optimizing infinitely-lived consumer (as in the Ramsey model). Workers and capitalists come together to produce output, using a production function that experiences labor-augmenting technological progress, and they earn the value of their marginal product. In addition, following the advice of Piketty, the government imposes a tax on capital equal to Ï„ per period, the revenue from which is transferred to workers.\n",
    "This is a fun-looking model, to be honest! Letting ChatGPT take the wheel for a moment:\n",
    "Mankiwâ€™s two-class modelâ€”workers who consume all income, capitalists who maximize consumption over an infinite horizonâ€”provides neat theoretical insights but fails to reflect real-world complexity.\n",
    "Thanks, o1! I totally agree!\n",
    "But, if there is one thing we ought to have learned in our Complexity Economics class from Professor @Joffa Applegate , it is that a model composed only of flows between capitalists and workers is a model that is blind to real modern-day economic function. Just last week we saw a model demonstrating the real, immediate impact of the existence of money and secondary debt markets: we had WernerÊ»s magic debit card.\n",
    "Capital makes money all sorts of ways, to the degree that it seems lately that workers are almost an afterthought. In the Uber model, for instance, big capital seeks out tiny little specks of capital to drink dry and leave the exogenous human impacts for governments to figure out.\n",
    "Nowhere in Professor MankiwÊ»s model is there a bank, an abstract financial instrument, or a credit card; as if these are not somehow vectors for rates of return in our modern economy. Nowhere is there an equation where r appears factored on both sides of the equation. Perhaps we are to understand that financialization is not relevant to the case at hand; but, itÊ»s hard to see how a discussion of national capital appreciation and growth rates would obviate the entire financial sector.\n",
    "Mankiw goes on to suggest an optimum capital tax rate of exactly zero. Even if it were practical in theory to set such a tax rate---presumably buffered by national collective nightly prayers that the wealthy wonÊ»t remember to hide all of their income in returns---the calculation of this optimum suffers the same flaw as before. The very equations that \"prove\" that the availability of capital benefits all workers fail to account for instances when capital bypasses them altogether. Sometimes capital takes a spin around town without the workers at all; though not necessarily without the Prius that Mom bought.\n",
    "I am somewhat suspicious that if we welded a monetary model onto MankiwÊ»s \"real\" (M-C-M) economy we would find that he has taken us three-fourths of the way to proving Piketty correct: r > g -> spiraling income equality.\n",
    "ðŸ’° ðŸ’° ðŸ’°\n",
    "The rest of the article is politics, surprisingly reminiscent of the back-pages musings of any given Samuel Alito Supreme Court opinion. Cruising through this editorial section we run into the particularly eye-catching:\n",
